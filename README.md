## Design

### Colour Palette

Below is the colour palette I used to create for the website, I initial planned to use different shades of blue as blue is widely viewed as a calming colour, my aim was to create a calm user experience. I only used three colours for my website.

### Font

I used the Google font Roboto.

### Content

Most of the content throughout the website were taken from YouTube calisthenics influences or channels, which were downloaded and converted into gifs. The reason for this is because I wanted to give the user an accurate outlook of what they can achieve, the gifs also make my website more appealing as it may intrigue the user, this is something royalty free image websites would've lacked due to a lack of content. The following links are the sources of the content for my content:
